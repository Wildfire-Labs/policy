# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Wildfire Labs understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a business associate, Wildfire Labs is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Wildfire Labs has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Wildfire Labs Customers to support data retention laws.

## **State Medical Record Laws**

## **Data Retention Policy**

Current Wildfire Labs Customers have data stored by Wildfire Labs as a part of the Wildfire Labs Service.

* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are implemented:
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of a change of standing, and given the option to reinstate the account.
  2. If no response to notice in \#1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate the account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Wildfire Labs and/or to have Wildfire Labs continue to store the data at a mutually agreed upon storage cost.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Wildfire Labs within 30 days, Wildfire Labs may remove data from Wildfire Labs systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
