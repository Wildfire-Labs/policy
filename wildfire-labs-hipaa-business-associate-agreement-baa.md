## **3. Obligations of Business Associate.**

* **3.1 Limit on Uses and Disclosures.** Business Associate will use or disclose PHI only as permitted by this BAA or as required by law, provided that any such use or disclosure would not violate HIPAA if done by a Covered Entity, unless permitted for a Business Associate under HIPAA.
* **3.2 Safeguards.** Business Associate will use reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent Use or Disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this BAA, consistent with the requirements of Subpart C of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 \(with respect to Electronic PHI\) as determined by Business Associate and as reflected in the Service Subscription Agreement.

* **3.4 Reporting of Security Incidents.** Business Associate will report to Customer on no less than fourteen business \(14\) days from the date any Security Incidents involving PHI of which Business Associate becomes aware in which there is a successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an Information System in a manner that risks the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information. Notice is hereby deemed provided, and no further notice will be provided, for unsuccessful attempts at such unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction, such as pings and other broadcast attacks on a firewall, denial of service attacks, port scans, unsuccessful login attempts, or interception of encrypted information where the key is not compromised, or any combination of the above.

* **3.7 Access to PHI.** Customer acknowledges that Business Associate is not required by this BAA to make disclosures of PHI to Individuals or any person other than Customer, and that Business Associate does not, therefore, expect to maintain documentation of such disclosure as described in 45 CFR § 164.528. In the event that Business Associate does make such disclosure, it shall document the disclosure as would be required for Customer to respond to a request by an Individual for an accounting of disclosures in accordance with 45 CFR §164.504\(e\)\(2\)\(ii\)\(G\) and §164.528, and shall provide such documentation to Customer promptly on Customer’s request.

If return or destruction is not feasible, Business Associate will extend the protections of this BAA to the PHI, limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return of the PHI infeasible, and make not further use or disclosure of PHI.
* **5.3** If Customer requests contemporaneously with any termination event or notice, Business Associate will allow Customer to have access to Customer’s account for a reasonable period of time following termination as necessary for Customer to retrieve or delete any PHI at its then current monthly recurring rate; provided, however, that if the security of Customer’s servers has been compromised, or the Service Subscription Agreement was terminated by Customer’s failure to use reasonable security precautions, Business Associate may: \(i\) provide Customer with restricted access via a dedicated or private link or tunnel to Customer account or \(ii\) refuse to allow Customer to have access to Customer’s account but will use reasonable efforts to copy Customer data on to media Customer provides to Business Associate, and will ship the media to Customer at Customer expense. **6. No Agency Relationship.** As set forth in the Service Subscription Agreement, nothing in this BAA is intended to make either party an agent of the other.
