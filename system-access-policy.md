## **Access Establishment and Modification**

* Requests for access to Wildfire Labs Platform systems and applications are made formally to the Privacy Officer or Security Officer.
* Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the Wildfire Labs Security Officer;
* The request for access is retained for future reference.
* All access to Wildfire Labs systems and services are reviewed and updated on an bi-annual basis to assure proper authorizations are in place commiserate with job functions. The form used to conduct account review is \[here\]
* Any Wildfire Labs workforce member can request change of access using this \[form\]
* Access to systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication.
* Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.
  * Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to assure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.
  * Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.
* In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of Wildfire Labs Customers to define, and not Wildfire Labs.
* All application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.
* Generic accounts are not allowed on Wildfire Labs systems.
* Shell access is restricted and can only be granted through encrypted, ssh tunnels.
* In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access.
* Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access.

## **Workforce Clearance**

* The level of security assigned to a user to the organization’s information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user’s job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.
* All access requests are treated on a “least-access principle.”

## **Access Authorization**

* Role based access categories for each Wildfire Labs system and application are pre-approved by the Security Officer.
* Wildfire Labs utilizes hardware and software firewalls to segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of service attacks.

## **Person or Entity Authentication**

* Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
* Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.

## **Unique User Identification**

* Access to the Wildfire Labs production systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and developer.
* Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls \(see below\).
* Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.
* Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.
* Shared accounts are not allowed within Wildfire Labs systems or networks.
* Automated log-on configurations that store user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with Wildfire Labs workstations or production systems.

## **Automatic Logoff**

* Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the users \(ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system\).
* Information systems automatically log users off the systems after 60 minutes of inactivity.
* The Security Officer pre-approves exceptions to automatic log off requirements.

## **Employee Workstation Use**

All workstations at Wildfire Labs are company owned, and are a mixture of Mac and Intel laptops running both MAC and WINDOWS operating systems

* Workstations may not be used to engage in any activity that is illegal or is in violation of organization’s policies.
* Access may not be used for transmitting, retrieving, or storage of any communications of a discriminatory or harassing nature or materials that are obscene or “X-rated”. Harassment of any kind is prohibited. No messages with derogatory or inflammatory remarks about an individual’s race, age, disability, religion, national origin, physical attributes, sexual preference, or health condition shall be transmitted or maintained. No abusive, hostile, profane, or offensive language is to be transmitted through the organization's system.
* Information systems/applications also may not be used for any other purpose that is illegal, unethical, or against company policies or contrary to organization’s best interests. Messages containing information related to a lawsuit or investigation may not be sent without prior approval.
* Solicitation of non-company business, or any use of organization’s information systems/applications for personal gain is prohibited.
* Transmitted messages may not contain material that criticizes organization, its providers, its employees, or others.
* Users may not misrepresent, obscure, suppress, or replace another user’s identity in transmitted or stored messages.
* Workstation hard drives will be encrypted using FileVault 2.0 and TrueCrypt
* All workstations have firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorized access unless explicitly granted.

## **Wireless Access Use**

* Wildfire Labs production systems are not accessible directly over wireless channels.
* Wireless access disabled on all production systems.
* When access production systems via remote wireless connections, the same system access policies and procedures apply to wireless as all other connections, including wired.
* Wireless networks managed within Wildfire Labs non-production facilities \(offices, etc\) are secured with the following configurations:
  * All data in transit over wireless is encrypted using WPA2 encryption;
  * Passwords are rotated on a regular basis, presently quarterly. This process is managed by the Wildfire Labs Security Officer.

## **Employee Termination Procedures**

* The Human Resources Department, users, and their supervisors are required to notify the Security Officer upon completion and/or termination of access needs and facilitate completion of the “Termination Checklist".
* The Human Resources Department, users, and supervisors are required to notify the IS Help Desk to terminate a user’s access rights if there is evidence or reason to believe the following \(these incidents are also reported on an incident report and is filed with the Privacy Officer\):
  * The user has been using their access rights inappropriately;
  * A user’s password has been compromised \(a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as the individual compromising the original password\);
  * An unauthorized individual is utilizing a user’s User Login ID and password \(a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as providing the unauthorized individual with the User Login ID and password\).
* The Security Officer will terminate users’ access rights immediately upon notification.
* The Security Officer audits and may terminate access of users that have not logged into the organization's information systems/applications for an extended period of time.

## **Paper Records**

Wildfire Labs does not use paper records for any sensitive information. Use of paper for recording and storing sensitive data is against Wildfire Labs policies.

## **Password Management**

* User IDs and passwords are used to control access to Wildfire Labs systems and may not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.
* Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information system using another user’s unique user ID and password.
* On all production systems and applications in the Wildfire Labs environment, password configurations are set to require that passwords are a minimum of 10 characters long. Additional requirements for length, mixed case, special characters, numbers, and password reuse can be enabled, and the inactivity timeout can be customized..
* All system and application passwords are salted and hashed with bcrypt to encrypt passwords.. The encrypted password hash is stored in the database and used for password validation on future user authentication attempts.\* Each information system may require users to change passwords at a predetermined interval as determined by the organization, based on the criticality and sensitivity of the ePHI contained within the network, system, application, and/or database.
* Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee’s termination \(refer to the termination procedures in this policy\).
* All default system, application, and Partner passwords are changed before deployment to production.
* All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.
* If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to immediately report the incident to the Security Officer.

## **Access to ePHI**

1. Employees may not download ePHI to any workstations used to connect to production systems.
2. Disallowing transfer of ePHI to workstations is enforced through technical measures.
   * All production access to systems is performed through a bastion/jump host accessed through a VPN. Direct access to production systems is disallowed by Wildfire Labs’s VPN configuration.
   * On production Linux bastions, all file transfer services are disabled including file-transfer functionality of SSH services \(SCP/SFTP\).
   * On production Windows bastions, local drive mappings are disabled by Group Policy settings.
   * Configuration settings for enforcing these technical controls are managed by Wildfire Labs’s configuration management tooling.
